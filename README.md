This is a personal tool I created for personal use. It's not accessible. It only has the small set of features I happen to need and a few that were just gratifying to add in. It's prematurely optimized out the wazoo despite not even being performance-sensitive because premature optimization happens to be my guilty pleasure, and that's not even the only way the codebase is modeled off of my sick JavaScript fantasies. Basically, it's terrible, and I don't recommend using it if you're not me. If you see potential in it, you're free to fork it and clean it up, but I'm satisfied with it the way it is.
